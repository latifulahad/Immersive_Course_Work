On this day we performed html exercise where we were introduced to form tags…which is a container that holds elements aka tags like <label><label< that work in conjunction with <input______/> or <select id=“” > && <option><option> which handle response from users aka these are more interactive rather then informative… Also, on this day we downloaded a git repo initialed folder that had many branches with errors in them that we had rectified…but were not able to push up to GitHub due to the folder being git initiated….also in the job environment we would have needed to downloaded each given branch and upon rectification we would need to merge the branches locally and pushed up the version that would appear as the one that would downloaded.. ANOTHER WAY TO DO THIS WOULD BE TO DOWNLOAD A GIVEN BRANCH AND CREATE MY OWN GIT INITIATED FOLDER(IN MY PERSONAL MACHINE)….IN WHICH I WOULD PLACE THE DOWNLOADED FILES AND WOULD __GIT REMOTE ADD ORIGIN URL___ FOR THE PROJECT REPO AND PUSH UP MY REVAMPED BRANCH FOR EVALUATION.
